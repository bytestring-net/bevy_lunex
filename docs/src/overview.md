> This crate is being maintained by a university student. Don't expect updates during the semester.

> [!WARNING]
> This crate is opinionated and thus you must decide if it is a good fit for what you want to achieve.
>
> This is mainly because Lunex provides you with only capability to position entities, leaving everything
> else in your hands. The current version also lacks any kind of flexbox-like layout.
